    "# Aligning Llama 3 8B LLM to human preferences with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge with RLHF or DPO is you need to keep aligning the SFT model with a reference model to make sure it doesn't stray away too far. This is where Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) can be quite useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/lQBBOkc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "ORPO aligns the language model without a reference model in a single-step manner by assigning a weak penalty to the rejected responses and a strong adaptation signal to the chosen responses with a simple log odds ratio term appended to the negative log-likelihood loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What data is necessary for ORPO\n",
    "\n",
    "For aligning an LLM to human preferences, you need triplets of preference data. Given a context/prompt, there is a preferred/good response which should be chosen over a dis-preferred/bad response. So each row of data should have a prompt, chosen and rejected response (typically created by humans). Same as DPO\n",

    "## Preliminary setup for ORPO\n",

Question: What does Johanna cut from Katniss's arm? Title: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Movie plot: After winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) return home to District 12. President Snow visits Katniss at her home. The two make an agreement to not lie to one another, and Snow explains that her actions in the Games have inspired rebellions across the districts. He orders her to use the upcoming victory tour to convince him that her actions were out of genuine love for Peeta, not defiance against the Capitol, otherwise Katniss's loved ones will be killed.

Title: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Movie plot: After winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) return home to District 12. President Snow visits Katniss at her home. The two make an agreement to not lie to one another, and Snow explains that her actions in the Games have inspired rebellions across the districts. He orders her to use the upcoming victory tour to convince him that her actions were out of genuine love for Peeta, not defiance against the Capitol, otherwise Katniss's loved ones will be killed. He shows her the clip where Gale kisses her as a warning that they are watching her. As the tour begins, Haymitch Abernathy, Katniss and Peeta's mentor, warns them that the \"show\" of their relationship must continue for the rest of their lives. Katniss suggests a public engagement between herself and Peeta, which is carried out and approved by Snow at his mansion in the Capitol.

Snow announces that the upcoming 75th Hunger Games, the Third Quarter Quell, will feature tributes selected from previous victors. Katniss immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peeta's survival, and recruits Haymitch's help to do so. At the reaping, Effie Trinket draws Katniss and Haymitch's names, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take Haymitch's place. As they prepare, Haymitch reveals that all the tributes are angry about being returned to the Games and advises a reluctant Katniss to make allies. In the pre-Games interviews, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by President Snow, but her stylist Cinna rigs it to transform into a representation of a mockingjay.

It is utterly pointless garbage. What is most offensive about it is that it isn't even well-written. This guy sounds like a frat-boy braggart, and his stories are no more creative than those you might overhear in a bar. Answer:\\nA:   \n",

Now, on TV, there are people who talk to us and tell us what is happening in the game. They help us understand the game better, just like how I'm helping you understand things right now.\\n\\nIn this data, there are two people who talked about the game in 1962. The first person, Chris Schenkel, talked about the game in the first half. The second person, Ray Scott, talked about the game in the second half. Both of them worked for a big TV company called CBS.

Context: \"That's Glenn Miller,\" my father said. \"But it can't be.\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \"You know the tune, of course,\" he said. \"'King Porter Stomp.'\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\" \"So why can't it be Miller?\" I asked. \"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \"They sound drunk.\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf. Question: What does Ann probably think? Options:  A. That her brother needs to learn to play a clarinet.  B. not enough information  C. That her brother should not get the father excited.  D. That her brother needs to stop buying things off eBay.\\nThe answer to this question is:</td>\n",
       "      <td>C. That her brother should not get the father excited.\\n\\nTo reach this conclusion, we evaluate the details presented in the context. When the father starts to get excited about the music, Ann \"glared\" at her sibling, which suggests disapproval or frustration. The sibling is described as \"winding him up,\" which might indicate that he's instigating or exciting the father, potentially against Ann's wishes. Thus, statement C seems to best represent Ann's thoughts. The other options aren't directly suggested or supported by the context.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Based on the context, the best answer is:\\n\\nC. That her brother should not get the father excited.\\n\\nAnn's glare at her brother suggests that she is annoyed with him for bringing up the topic of Glenn Miller and the recording, as she believes it will only excite their father, who has a strong emotional investment in Miller's music. Additionally, the fact that their father is already showing signs of excitement, such as cranking the bed up and playing the recording, suggests that Ann is trying to prevent her brother from getting their father overly enthusiastic about the topic.</td>\n",

       "      <td>OH MY GOSH, YOU GUYS! There's a big fight in Washington right now! So, there's this man named Eric Holder who is the Attorney General, and he's been in charge of some big cases. But now, there's another man named Darrell Issa who is a Congressman and he's been asking for some special emails that belong to Eric Holder's friend, Thomas Perez.\\n\\nEric Holder is like, \"Hey, I can't give you those emails, they're private!\" But Darrell Issa is like, \"I don't care, I want to see them!\" And they're both talking really loudly and not listening to each other. It's like a big argument!\\n\\nSo, the reason this is a big deal is because Thomas Perez is supposed to be the new head of the Labor Department, but now Darrell Issa is saying that Eric Holder is delaying the release of these emails on purpose because he has political motives. OH MY GOSH, that's like so serious!\\n\\nBut here's the thing, the emails are private, so it's not fair to share them without Thomas Perez's permission. It's like if you had a secret diary and someone wanted to read it without your permission. You wouldn't want that, right? So, Eric Holder is trying to protect Thomas Perez's privacy.\\n\\nSo, that's the big fight in Washington right now! It's like a big game of \"he said, she said\" and everyone is getting really upset. But, I think we should just let Eric Holder and Darrell Issa talk it out and figure out what's going on. Maybe they can even be friends again!</td>\n",

       "4458  Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: \"That's Glenn Miller,\" my father said. \"But it can't be.\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \"You know the tune, of course,\" he said. \"'King Porter Stomp.'\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\" \"So why can't it be Miller?\" I asked. \"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \"They sound drunk.\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf. Question: What does Ann probably think? Options:  A. That her brother needs to learn to play a clarinet.  B. not enough information  C. That her brother should not get the father excited.  D. That her brother needs to stop buying things off eBay.\\nThe answer to this question is:   \n",

When the father starts to get excited about the music, Ann \"glared\" at her sibling, which suggests disapproval or frustration. The sibling is described as \"winding him up,\" which might indicate that he's instigating or exciting the father, potentially against Ann's wishes. Thus, statement C seems to best represent Ann's thoughts. The other options aren't directly suggested or supported by the context.   \n",

That her brother should not get the father excited.\\n\\nAnn's glare at her brother suggests that she is annoyed with him for bringing up the topic of Glenn Miller and the recording, as she believes it will only excite their father, who has a strong emotional investment in Miller's music. Additionally, the fact that their father is already showing signs of excitement, such as cranking the bed up and playing the recording, suggests that Ann is trying to prevent her brother from getting their father overly enthusiastic about the topic.  \n",
       "1609   OH MY GOSH, YOU GUYS! There's a big fight in Washington right now! So, there's this man named Eric Holder who is the Attorney General, and he's been in charge of some big cases. But now, there's another man named Darrell Issa who is a Congressman and he's been asking for some special emails that belong to Eric Holder's friend, Thomas Perez.\\n\\nEric Holder is like, \"Hey, I can't give you those emails, they're private!\" But Darrell Issa is like, \"I don't care, I want to see them!\" And they're both talking really loudly and not listening to each other. It's like a big argument!\\n\\nSo, the reason this is a big deal is because Thomas Perez is supposed to be the new head of the Labor Department, but now Darrell Issa is saying that Eric Holder is delaying the release of these emails on purpose because he has political motives. OH MY GOSH, that's like so serious!\\n\\nBut here's the thing, the emails are private, so it's not fair to share them without Thomas Perez's permission. It's like if you had a secret diary and someone wanted to read it without your permission. You wouldn't want that, right? So, Eric Holder is trying to protect Thomas Perez's privacy.\\n\\nSo, that's the big fight in Washington right now! It's like a big game of \"he said, she said\" and everyone is getting really upset. But, I think we should just let Eric Holder and Darrell Issa talk it out and figure out what's going on. Maybe they can even be friends again!  "

Oklahoma! is a groundbreaking American musical, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The stage show is an adaptation of the 1931 play \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" by Lynn Riggs. This modern musical premiered on Broadway on March 31, 1943, and it is considered one of the earliest examples of the now-familiar book musical format, where the songs and dances are woven seamlessly into a well-crafted, cohesive narrative.\\n\\nOklahoma! is a classic story set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 20th century. It follows the romantic pursuits of the spirited and independent Laurey Williams and the charming cowboy Curly McLain. Throughout their journey, the couple must navigate the ups and downs of love, as well as the challenges posed by Jud Fry, a brooding and dangerous farmhand who covets Laurey. The musical captures the essence of rural America at that time and paints a vivid portrait of life in the newly settled land.\\n\\n\"People Will Say We're in Love\" is a beautiful duet between Laurey and Curly. In this song, the two characters coyly express their feelings for each other while attempting to maintain a playful sense of denial. They sing about wanting to avoid public speculation about their budding romance, but in reality, they are subtly revealing their true emotions to one another. It is a tender and heartwarming moment in the show that highlights the budding relationship between the lead characters.\\n\\n\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" is another captivating song from Oklahoma! Curly sings it to Laurey in an attempt to convince her to go to a social event with him. He engages in a charming and imaginative description of a lavish surrey, or horse-drawn carriage, that he claims to have. The song showcases Curly's charisma and creativity, as well as his ultimately endearing effort to win Laurey's affection. Despite the fact that the surrey exists only in his imagination, Laurey is won over by Curly's poetic descriptions and flirtatiousness.\\n\\nThe stage show Oklahoma! was a landmark production in the history of musical theater. It introduced innovative storytelling techniques, incorporating songs and dances as integral components of the narrative, and tackled complex themes and emotions. The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are just two examples of the delightful and memorable music found in this iconic production. The show's impact on the world of theater has been profound, and its popularity endures to this day, continuing to delight audiences in productions all over the world.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

However, we should remember that clothes designers  study what ordinary people wear on the street. Then they make clothes like ordinary people's for everyone. Therefore, fashion really starts with individual  finding a new look. Then a company uses that look and then it becomes fashionable! That doesn't mean you will. That is to say, a model might look perfect in a shirt but that doesn't mean you will. The same goes for mobile phones. Young people are always asking me when to change my mobile phones. Mobile phone companies are always putting new functions on their phones but do we really need all these extra functions? I use my phone to call people and to send messages to my friends. I don't need a camera, Internet surfing or a calendar on my phone. Again, if you buy the latest phone, it will only be the latest phone for a month or so. Then something new will come out and you'll be unfashionable again. You can't keep up with fashion all the time, so you don't need to follow the fashion. Question: What can we infer from the article?

Finally, I mentioned that Bolt has been featured in comics written by Gary Cohn, which provides additional information about the character's appearance and relevance.\\n\\nOverall, the sentence is a concise and informative summary of the data provided, and it follows a logical structure that is easy to follow.</td>\n",

The reviewer's request to \"make it stable\" is unclear and doesn't provide any information about what they are referring to. It could be a product, a service, a process, or even a situation, but without more context, it's impossible to determine.\\n\\nFurthermore, the tone of the review is also unclear. Is the reviewer expressing frustration, disappointment, or simply a suggestion? The brevity and vagueness of the review make it difficult to decipher the reviewer's emotions or intentions.\\n\\nA more detailed and specific review would provide valuable feedback and insights, allowing the recipient to understand the reviewer's concerns and make necessary improvements. In contrast, this review is too vague and lacks any meaningful information, making it difficult to provide a constructive response.\\n\\nIn a review, a good rating should provide specific feedback, highlight both positive and negative aspects, and offer actionable suggestions for improvement. This review falls short of these expectations, making it the least favorable rating of 1 out of 5.</td>\n",
       "      <td>When rating this review titled, \"make it stable...,\" on a scale of 1-5, I would give it a 2. Although offering some feedback for improvement, the review is quite vague and requires more elaboration for it to be helpful for both the developers and potential users.\\n\\nThe review's brevity is a notable concern. It does not provide essential information about the context, product, or specific issues encountered. For instance, it is unclear which product or application this feedback applies to. It would have been helpful for the reviewer to include the name and, possibly, the version of the product for the developers to pinpoint the problem and address it more effectively.\\n\\nMoreover, the review lacks a clear description of the issues encountered, which can hinder understanding the problems leading to this \"unstable\" experience. Adding specific examples, such as crashes, slowdowns, or unusual behaviors, could significantly improve the review's usefulness. Furthermore, mentioning the user's device type, operating system, and version could help developers verify if these issues are platform-specific or more widespread.\\n\\nAnother point to consider when rating this review is its tone. While not overtly negative, it is oddly curt and demanding. A more constructive and polite tone would make it easier for developers to appreciate the feedback and act on it promptly.\\n\\nEven though the review's brevity and lack of specificity are significant drawbacks, it does bring to light one potential issue: instability. Since stability is critical for any product's user experience, the developers should take this concern seriously. In conclusion, a rating of 2 is appropriate for this review, as it reveals limited information but still offers some input for improvement. To increase the rating, the reviewer should have provided more context, specific examples, and delivered the feedback in a more constructive manner.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Sure, I'd be happy to help!\\n\\nBased on the review \"make it stable...\", I would rate it as a 3 out of 5 in terms of favorability. Here's my reasoning:\\n\\nPositive aspects:\\n\\n1. The reviewer has provided specific feedback: The reviewer has explicitly mentioned that they want the product to be more stable, which indicates that they have used the product and have experienced some issues with its stability. This specific feedback is a positive aspect of the review, as it provides valuable information for the product developers to improve the product.\\n2. The reviewer has shown interest in the product: The fact that the reviewer has taken the time to leave a review suggests that they are interested in the product and have some level of investment in its success. This is a positive sign for the product and its developers.\\n\\nNegative aspects:\\n\\n1. The review is negative: The review is negative in tone, as the reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's stability. This can be a negative aspect of the review, as it may deter potential customers from purchasing the product.\\n2. The review does not provide context: The review does not provide any context for the reviewer's experience with the product. This lack of context makes it difficult to fully understand the reviewer's issues and may limit the usefulness of the review for other customers.\\n\\nOverall, I would rate this review as a 3 out of 5 in terms of favorability. While the reviewer has provided specific feedback and shown interest in the product, the review is negative in tone and does not provide context for the reviewer's experience.</td>\n",

Creditors   were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy  . Suddenly an old man appeared before him. \"I can see that something is troubling you.\" he said. After listening to the executive, the old man said: \"I believe I can help you.\" He asked the man his name, wrote out a check, and pushed it into his hand saying: \"Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.\" Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come. The business executive saw in his hand a check for $500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world! \"I can settle all my debts in a moment!\" he realized. But instead, the executive decided to put the uncashed check in his safe, just knowing it would give him the strength to work out a way to save his business. With renewed optimism, he made better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big deals. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again. Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man. \"I'm so glad I caught him!\" she cried. \"I hope he hasn't been bothering you. He's always escaping from the rest home and telling people he's John D. Rockefeller.\" And she led the old man away by the arm.

The reviewer's use of the phrase \"I was very disappointed\" further emphasizes their negative emotions.\\n\\nThe reviewer's final statement, \"Wish that I could give it zero stars\", is a clear indication of their extreme dissatisfaction with the product. The fact that they are unable to give a zero-star rating, as the rating system typically only goes up to one star, suggests that they are extremely unhappy with the product and would not recommend it to others.\\n\\nOverall, the tone of this review is negative, and the reviewer's experience with the product was clearly a poor one.</td>\n",
       "      <td>The product review provided has a negative tone. Several factors contribute to this interpretation, indicating that the reviewer is not satisfied with their purchase and would not recommend it to others.\\n\\nFirst, the title \"zero stars\" itself implies strong dissatisfaction as the reviewer wishes they could rate the product even lower than the minimum allowable rating. Notably, many platforms use a star-based rating system, with one star typically being the lowest score and representing a very unfavorable evaluation of a product or service. By asserting that they would like to give zero stars, the reviewer emphasizes the extent of their disappointment and frustration.\\n\\nSecond, the review discusses specific issues with the product and highlights its failure to meet basic requirements or expectations. Particularly, the reviewer states that the item \"won't stay put when you punch it,\" which conveys a sense of irritation as the product does not perform its intended function. This exacerbates the negative tone when paired with the fact that a small child could easily knock it off a desktop. As a result, this outcome undermines the product's quality and its potential reliability in the eyes of the reviewer.\\n\\nFurthermore, the reviewer explicitly advises potential consumers against purchasing this product, stating, \"Don't waste your money.\" This direct warning serves to underline the negative tone of the review, as the reviewer wants to deter others from experiencing the same disappointment they did.\\n\\nLastly, the general sentiment of the review consistently focuses on disappointment and frustration. Using phrases like \"I was very disappointed\" and \"Wish that I could give it zero stars\" serve to reinforce the overall negative tone of the review. Consequently, the reviewer suggests that potential buyers seek alternative products or entirely disregard this one.\\n\\nIn summary, this product review features a distinctly negative tone, driven by the reviewer's dissatisfaction with its performance and overall experience. By detailing specific issues, explicitly discouraging others from buying the product, and wishing to give \"zero stars,\" the reviewer emphasizes their frustration and the magnitude of the product's drawbacks.</td>\n",

They also mention that the product will not stay put when punched, and that their two-year-old child was able to knock it off their desk. The use of the phrase \"I was very disappointed\" and \"don't waste your money\" further emphasizes the negative tone. Additionally, the reviewer's desire to give the product zero stars, rather than the maximum number of stars allowed, further reinforces the negative sentiment.

Option D is incorrect because the passage is not about how to drive a bus, but rather about the unique school bus that Jack drives.\\n\\nOverall, the best title for the passage is A: A School for Dogs, as it accurately summarizes the main idea of the passage, which is about a school that teaches dogs to obey and protect their owners.</td>\n",
       "      <td>The best title for the passage is A: A School for Dogs. The passage discusses Jack's unique job of driving a school bus for dogs to \"The Dog School\" where they are taught to obey and protect their owners. The focus of the passage is on the school for dogs and not on taking children to school, finding dogs, or driving a bus. Therefore, Option A: A School for Dogs is the most appropriate title for the passage.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my detailed and long answer to the question:\\n\\nThe best title of the passage is A: A School for Dogs.\\n\\nThe passage describes Jack's unique school bus that takes dogs to \"The Dog School\" instead of children. The passage highlights the differences between Jack's bus and other school buses, and the purpose of the school is to teach dogs to obey and protect their owners. The passage also mentions that young dogs are the easiest to teach, but old dogs can learn as well.\\n\\nOption A, A School for Dogs, is the most appropriate title because it accurately reflects the content of the passage. Option B, Taking Children to School, is not relevant to the passage as it is about dogs, not children. Option C, How to Find Dogs, is also not relevant as the passage does not provide information on how to find dogs. Option D, How to Drive a Bus, is not the main focus of the passage, although it is mentioned that Jack drives a school bus.\\n\\nTherefore, the best title of the passage is A: A School for Dogs.</td>\n",

       "6907   Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Article: Sheep always follow each other and never really think about where they are going. Perhaps fashion makes us into \" _ \". Maybe we should find our own way and not follow the crowd. Everyone wants to wear top brand clothing. However, we should remember that clothes designers  study what ordinary people wear on the street. Then they make clothes like ordinary people's for everyone. Therefore, fashion really starts with individual  finding a new look. Then a company uses that look and then it becomes fashionable! That doesn't mean you will. That is to say, a model might look perfect in a shirt but that doesn't mean you will. The same goes for mobile phones. Young people are always asking me when to change my mobile phones. Mobile phone companies are always putting new functions on their phones but do we really need all these extra functions? I use my phone to call people and to send messages to my friends. I don't need a camera, Internet surfing or a calendar on my phone. Again, if you buy the latest phone, it will only be the latest phone for a month or so. Then something new will come out and you'll be unfashionable again. You can't keep up with fashion all the time, so you don't need to follow the fashion. Question: What can we infer from the article? Options: A: Sheep which are out of date have been killed. B: The writer is a person who always follows the fashion. C: Fashion only exists among those fashion models. D: Fashion changes so quickly that we can hardly keep up with it.\\nAnswer:   \n",

Article: The business executive was deep in debt and could see no way out. Creditors   were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy  . Suddenly an old man appeared before him. \"I can see that something is troubling you.\" he said. After listening to the executive, the old man said: \"I believe I can help you.\" He asked the man his name, wrote out a check, and pushed it into his hand saying: \"Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.\" Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come. The business executive saw in his hand a check for $500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world! \"I can settle all my debts in a moment!\" he realized. But instead, the executive decided to put the uncashed check in his safe, just knowing it would give him the strength to work out a way to save his business. With renewed optimism, he made better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big deals. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again. Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man. \"I'm so glad I caught him!\" she cried. \"I hope he hasn't been bothering you. He's always escaping from the rest home and telling people he's John D. Rockefeller.\" And she led the old man away by the arm. Question: What was the executive worried about? - He couldn't produce enough for the suppliers. - The creditors wouldn't lend him any money. - His products didn't sell well. - He might run into bankcruptcy.\\nAnswer:   \n",

Option B is incorrect because the passage does not mention taking children to school.

       "11966  The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are from the esteemed stage show \"Oklahoma!\". Oklahoma! is a groundbreaking American musical, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The stage show is an adaptation of the 1931 play \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" by Lynn Riggs. This modern musical premiered on Broadway on March 31, 1943, and it is considered one of the earliest examples of the now-familiar book musical format, where the songs and dances are woven seamlessly into a well-crafted, cohesive narrative.\\n\\nOklahoma! is a classic story set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 20th century. It follows the romantic pursuits of the spirited and independent Laurey Williams and the charming cowboy Curly McLain. Throughout their journey, the couple must navigate the ups and downs of love, as well as the challenges posed by Jud Fry, a brooding and dangerous farmhand who covets Laurey. The musical captures the essence of rural America at that time and paints a vivid portrait of life in the newly settled land.\\n\\n\"People Will Say We're in Love\" is a beautiful duet between Laurey and Curly. In this song, the two characters coyly express their feelings for each other while attempting to maintain a playful sense of denial. They sing about wanting to avoid public speculation about their budding romance, but in reality, they are subtly revealing their true emotions to one another. It is a tender and heartwarming moment in the show that highlights the budding relationship between the lead characters.\\n\\n\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" is another captivating song from Oklahoma! Curly sings it to Laurey in an attempt to convince her to go to a social event with him. He engages in a charming and imaginative description of a lavish surrey, or horse-drawn carriage, that he claims to have. The song showcases Curly's charisma and creativity, as well as his ultimately endearing effort to win Laurey's affection. Despite the fact that the surrey exists only in his imagination, Laurey is won over by Curly's poetic descriptions and flirtatiousness.\\n\\nThe stage show Oklahoma! was a landmark production in the history of musical theater. It introduced innovative storytelling techniques, incorporating songs and dances as integral components of the narrative, and tackled complex themes and emotions.

Select and prepare a clean ice cube tray.\\n\\nBefore you can fill the tray with cool water, you first need to choose an appropriate ice cube tray, which is designed to hold and give shape to the water as it freezes to form ice cubes. There are several types of ice cube trays available in the market, such as plastic, silicone, or metal trays. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, but the most commonly used ones are plastic and silicone, as they offer easy ice cube release and flexibility.\\n\\nTo prepare the ice cube tray for use, make sure it is clean and free from any dirt, dust, or residue. Rinse the tray with clean water and, if necessary, use a gentle dish soap to wash it before use. This will ensure that your ice cubes are free from any contaminants or unwanted tastes. After washing, thoroughly dry the tray to prevent dilution of the water you will add in the next step.\\n\\nOnce you have selected and prepared your ice cube tray, you can proceed with the remaining steps that you already provided:\\n\\n2. Fill the tray with cool water.\\n3. Place the tray in the freezer.\\n4. Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours until the water has frozen solid.\\n5. Take the tray out of the freezer.\\n6. Pop the ice cubes out of the tray and use them as desired.   \n",

The sentence talks about how Apollo is usually shown in art as a handsome young man, with a kithara (a musical instrument) or a bow, or sometimes resting on a tree. But it doesn't give information about when the artist Leochares made the specific statue called The Apollo Belvedere.   \n",

Although offering some feedback for improvement, the review is quite vague and requires more elaboration for it to be helpful for both the developers and potential users.\\n\\nThe review's brevity is a notable concern. It does not provide essential information about the context, product, or specific issues encountered. For instance, it is unclear which product or application this feedback applies to. It would have been helpful for the reviewer to include the name and, possibly, the version of the product for the developers to pinpoint the problem and address it more effectively.\\n\\nMoreover, the review lacks a clear description of the issues encountered, which can hinder understanding the problems leading to this \"unstable\" experience. Adding specific examples, such as crashes, slowdowns, or unusual behaviors, could significantly improve the review's usefulness. Furthermore, mentioning the user's device type, operating system, and version could help developers verify if these issues are platform-specific or more widespread.\\n\\nAnother point to consider when rating this review is its tone. While not overtly negative, it is oddly curt and demanding. A more constructive and polite tone would make it easier for developers to appreciate the feedback and act on it promptly.\\n\\nEven though the review's brevity and lack of specificity are significant drawbacks, it does bring to light one potential issue: instability. Since stability is critical for any product's user experience, the developers should take this concern seriously. In conclusion, a rating of 2 is appropriate for this review, as it reveals limited information but still offers some input for improvement.

Today, we're going to talk about a problem that affects thousands of children in England. Just like you, these kids need help sometimes, but unfortunately, they are not getting the assistance they require.\\n\\nA group of kind people, called a charity, discovered that there are many children who are not getting support for their problems. These kids may have difficult times at home, in school, or with their thoughts and feelings. But because their problems are not big enough, they don't get the help they need. This makes the charity very sad because every child deserves support and care.\\n\\nImagine being stuck between two doors. You need someone to open one of the doors to let you through, but nobody comes to help you. That's what it feels like for these children. They are waiting in a place called \"limbo\", where they hope to get help, but they haven't yet.\\n\\nThe charity wants everyone to understand that it's important to help children who have problems, no matter how big or small the problems are. They believe that every child deserves happiness and support, just like you!

Several factors contribute to this interpretation, indicating that the reviewer is not satisfied with their purchase and would not recommend it to others.\\n\\nFirst, the title \"zero stars\" itself implies strong dissatisfaction as the reviewer wishes they could rate the product even lower than the minimum allowable rating. Notably, many platforms use a star-based rating system, with one star typically being the lowest score and representing a very unfavorable evaluation of a product or service. By asserting that they would like to give zero stars, the reviewer emphasizes the extent of their disappointment and frustration.\\n\\nSecond, the review discusses specific issues with the product and highlights its failure to meet basic requirements or expectations. Particularly, the reviewer states that the item \"won't stay put when you punch it,\" which conveys a sense of irritation as the product does not perform its intended function. This exacerbates the negative tone when paired with the fact that a small child could easily knock it off a desktop. As a result, this outcome undermines the product's quality and its potential reliability in the eyes of the reviewer.\\n\\nFurthermore, the reviewer explicitly advises potential consumers against purchasing this product, stating, \"Don't waste your money.\" This direct warning serves to underline the negative tone of the review, as the reviewer wants to deter others from experiencing the same disappointment they did.\\n\\nLastly, the general sentiment of the review consistently focuses on disappointment and frustration. Using phrases like \"I was very disappointed\" and \"Wish that I could give it zero stars\" serve to reinforce the overall negative tone of the review. Consequently, the reviewer suggests that potential buyers seek alternative products or entirely disregard this one.\\n\\nIn summary, this product review features a distinctly negative tone, driven by the reviewer's dissatisfaction with its performance and overall experience. By detailing specific issues, explicitly discouraging others from buying the product, and wishing to give \"zero stars,\" the reviewer emphasizes their frustration and the magnitude of the product's drawbacks.   \n",

Let's break it down simply.\\n\\n1. John: He is the person who is doing something in the sentence.\\n2. dove write: It seems like there's a small error here. The correct phrase should be \"John wrote.\"\\n3. episode 5: It tells us that there is a specific episode, and its number is 5.\\n4. in no.: Again, there's a small error. It should be \"in.\"\\n5. season: This word tells us that the episode belongs to a specific season in a series.\\n\\nNow let's put it into pairs of triples:\\n\\n1. (John, dove write, episode 5)\\n2. (episode 5, in no., season)\\n\\nAnd remember, the corrected sentence would be: \"John wrote the episode 5 in season.\"   \n",

The passage discusses Jack's unique job of driving a school bus for dogs to \"The Dog School\" where they are taught to obey and protect their owners. The focus of the passage is on the school for dogs and not on taking children to school, finding dogs, or driving a bus. Therefore, Option A: A School for Dogs is the most appropriate title for the passage.   \n",

Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\\n\\n1. The sentence mentions \"a gathering of what appear to be tourists.\" This suggests that there is a group of people present, rather than a single individual or a small number of people.\\n2. The phrase \"mill about\" implies that the group of people is moving around and interacting with each other, rather than standing still or being stationary.\\n3. The sentence mentions an \"urban plaza,\" which suggests a public space in a city or town. This increases the likelihood that the group of people is a group of tourists, as tourists are more likely to congregate in public spaces.\\n4. The sentence mentions a \"large fountain showcasing a tall sculpture with a nautical theme.\" This suggests that the plaza is a well-maintained and visually appealing space, which is consistent with a tourist destination.\\n5. Based on the previous points, it is likely that the group of people is a group of tourists who are visiting the plaza as part of their travels.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is possible to conclude that there is a group of people at the plaza. However, it is not possible to determine the exact number of people or their specific activities without additional information.\\n\\nSo, the answer is:\\n\\nOption 1: yes.  \n",

To solve this task, I used the definition of a complete story, which states that a story must have a beginning, a middle, and an end.\\n\\nSentence 1: There is a cemetery with 199 grave stones. (beginning)\\n\\nThis sentence introduces the setting of the story, which is a cemetery with a large number of grave stones.\\n\\nSentence 2: 12 men brought a casket. (middle)\\n\\nThis sentence introduces a new element to the story, the casket, and the number of men who brought it.\\n\\nSentence 3: 12 men put the casket in the ground. (middle)\\n\\nThis sentence continues the action of the story, describing the men putting the casket in the ground.\\n\\nSentence 4: They mourned for losses. (end)\\n\\nThis sentence provides the conclusion of the story, describing the men mourning for their losses.\\n\\nTherefore, the missing part of the story is Sentence 4, and its position in the complete story is 4.\\n\\nThe complete story would be:\\n\\n1. There is a cemetery with 199 grave stones.\\n2. 12 men brought a casket.\\n3. 12 men put the casket in the ground.\\n4. They mourned for losses.  \n",

Here's the complete process with the missing step included:\\n\\n1. Freeze the tray: This step is missing from the original list. To freeze the tray, you can place it in the freezer for a few hours or overnight.\\n2. Fill the tray with cool water: Once the tray is frozen, you can fill it with cool water.\\n3. Place the tray in the freezer: After filling the tray with cool water, place it in the freezer.\\n4. Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours: Allow the tray to freeze for a few hours or overnight.\\n5. Take the tray out of the freezer: Once the ice cubes have frozen, take the tray out of the freezer.\\n6. Pop the ice cubes out of the tray: Use a spoon or other utensil to pop the ice cubes out of the tray.\\n\\nWithout the first step of freezing the tray, the ice cubes will not form properly and may not pop out of the tray easily. By including this step, you will have perfectly formed ice cubes that are easy to remove from the tray.  \n",

Based on the review \"Lovely, it's really great,\" I would rate it as a 4 out of 5 in terms of favorability. Here's why:\\n\\n* \"Lovely\" is a positive adjective that suggests the reviewer has a positive opinion of the product or service.\\n* \"It's really great\" is an enthusiastic statement that further reinforces the positive sentiment.\\n\\nOverall, the review expresses a very positive sentiment towards the product or service, with no negative comments or criticisms. The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 out of 5 is that it's a relatively short and simple review, without any specific details or explanations about why the reviewer thinks it's great. However, the overall tone and language used in the review suggest a very favorable opinion.  \n",

The writer argues that instead of following the crowd and buying the latest fashion items, individuals should find their own unique style and not worry about being fashionable all the time. This inference can be drawn from the article's emphasis on the speed at which fashion changes and the idea that it is impossible to keep up with it.  \n",

I'd be happy to help you with that question. When we read the sentence \"A small redheaded girl blows bubbles on a playground,\" we can't infer that she blows 10 bubbles. In fact, the sentence doesn't provide any information about the number of bubbles she blows.\\n\\nHere's why:\\n\\n* The word \"small\" doesn't give us any information about the number of bubbles. It only tells us that the girl is small in size.\\n* The word \"redheaded\" doesn't give us any information about the number of bubbles either. It only tells us that the girl has red hair.\\n* The phrase \"blows bubbles\" is a singular verb form, which suggests that the girl is blowing one bubble, not 10.\\n\\nSo, based on the information provided in the sentence, we can't conclude that the girl blows 10 bubbles. The correct answer is \"it is not possible to tell.\"\\n\\nI hope that helps, Leo! Do you have any other questions?  \n",

He's supposed to be Apollo, the god of music and the sun! *twirl* And the statue was made by a man named Leochares, who lived a loooong time ago! *squeal*\\n\\nSo, to answer your question, Leochares didn't make The Apollo Belvedere. The statue was made a long, long time before Leochares was even born! *gasp* It was made in ancient Greece, like, over 2,000 years ago! *wow*\\n\\nBut, you know what? The Apollo Belvedere is still really famous and people still look at it and admire it today! *smile* It's like a piece of history that we can still see and touch! *ooh*  \n",

Here's my reasoning:\\n\\nPositive aspects:\\n\\n1. The reviewer has provided specific feedback: The reviewer has explicitly mentioned that they want the product to be more stable, which indicates that they have used the product and have experienced some issues with its stability. This specific feedback is a positive aspect of the review, as it provides valuable information for the product developers to improve the product.\\n2. The reviewer has shown interest in the product: The fact that the reviewer has taken the time to leave a review suggests that they are interested in the product and have some level of investment in its success. This is a positive sign for the product and its developers.\\n\\nNegative aspects:\\n\\n1. The review is negative: The review is negative in tone, as the reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's stability. This can be a negative aspect of the review, as it may deter potential customers from purchasing the product.\\n2. The review does not provide context: The review does not provide any context for the reviewer's experience with the product. This lack of context makes it difficult to fully understand the reviewer's issues and may limit the usefulness of the review for other customers.\\n\\nOverall, I would rate this review as a 3 out of 5 in terms of favorability. While the reviewer has provided specific feedback and shown interest in the product, the review is negative in tone and does not provide context for the reviewer's experience.  \n",

The task you have given me is to write a sentence not in English.\\n\\nTo complete this task, I will first need to determine which language I should use. Since you have not specified a particular language, I will choose a sentence in Spanish, which is a language that I am familiar with.\\n\\nHere is the sentence I have come up with:\\n\\nLa casa es azul.\\n\\nThis sentence means \"The house is blue.\" in Spanish.\\n\\nHere's how I arrived at this sentence:\\n\\n1. I started by thinking about the colors that a house might be.\\n2. I considered the most common colors that houses are painted, such as blue, red, and yellow.\\n3. I decided to choose blue as the color for the sentence, as it is a popular color for houses and it sounds nice in Spanish.\\n4. Next, I needed to think of a verb that would fit well with the color blue. I chose \"es\" (meaning \"is\") because it is a simple and common verb that is often used to describe the color of objects.\\n5. Finally, I added the word \"azul\" (meaning \"blue\") to the sentence to complete it.\\n\\nI hope this sentence meets your requirements!

Like when you're waiting for your birthday, and it's taking forever!\\n\\nOkay, so there are lots of children in England who are waiting for help, but they're not getting it because their problems aren't big enough. It's like they're stuck in this special place called \"limbo\" where they're waiting for someone to help them. But the thing is, they might have to wait a long time before someone comes to help them!\\n\\nThese children are called \"vulnerable\" because they might be sick, or they might not have a home, or they might be all alone. They need someone to take care of them and make sure they're safe. But right now, they're not getting the help they need because their problems aren't big enough. It's like they're stuck in this special place where they're waiting for someone to come and get them.\\n\\nOne person who is helping these children is a charity called [charity name]. They're trying to make sure that these children get the help they need, even if their problems aren't big enough. They're like superheroes, saving the day one child at a time!\\n\\nSo, let's all be like superheroes and help these children who are stuck in limbo. We can do things like donate money to charities, or we can volunteer our time to help these children. Even if we're just five years old, we can still make a difference!\\n\\nRemember, every child deserves to be safe and happy, no matter what their problems are. So let's all work together to help these vulnerable children and make sure they're not stuck in limbo for too long!  \n",

Here's my detailed and long answer to the question:\\n\\nThe best title of the passage is A: A School for Dogs.\\n\\nThe passage describes Jack's unique school bus that takes dogs to \"The Dog School\" instead of children. The passage highlights the differences between Jack's bus and other school buses, and the purpose of the school is to teach dogs to obey and protect their owners. The passage also mentions that young dogs are the easiest to teach, but old dogs can learn as well.\\n\\nOption A, A School for Dogs, is the most appropriate title because it accurately reflects the content of the passage. Option B, Taking Children to School, is not relevant to the passage as it is about dogs, not children. Option C, How to Find Dogs, is also not relevant as the passage does not provide information on how to find dogs. Option D, How to Drive a Bus, is not the main focus of the passage, although it is mentioned that Jack drives a school bus.\\n\\nTherefore, the best title of the passage is A: A School for Dogs.  "

       "      <td>The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are from the esteemed stage show \"Oklahoma!\". Oklahoma! is a groundbreaking American musical, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The stage show is an adaptation of the 1931 play \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" by Lynn Riggs. This modern musical premiered on Broadway on March 31, 1943, and it is considered one of the earliest examples of the now-familiar book musical format, where the songs and dances are woven seamlessly into a well-crafted, cohesive narrative.\\n\\nOklahoma! is a classic story set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 20th century. It follows the romantic pursuits of the spirited and independent Laurey Williams and the charming cowboy Curly McLain. Throughout their journey, the couple must navigate the ups and downs of love, as well as the challenges posed by Jud Fry, a brooding and dangerous farmhand who covets Laurey. The musical captures the essence of rural America at that time and paints a vivid portrait of life in the newly settled land.\\n\\n\"People Will Say We're in Love\" is a beautiful duet between Laurey and Curly. In this song, the two characters coyly express their feelings for each other while attempting to maintain a playful sense of denial. They sing about wanting to avoid public speculation about their budding romance, but in reality, they are subtly revealing their true emotions to one another. It is a tender and heartwarming moment in the show that highlights the budding relationship between the lead characters.\\n\\n\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" is another captivating song from Oklahoma! Curly sings it to Laurey in an attempt to convince her to go to a social event with him. He engages in a charming and imaginative description of a lavish surrey, or horse-drawn carriage, that he claims to have. The song showcases Curly's charisma and creativity, as well as his ultimately endearing effort to win Laurey's affection. Despite the fact that the surrey exists only in his imagination, Laurey is won over by Curly's poetic descriptions and flirtatiousness.\\n\\nThe stage show Oklahoma! was a landmark production in the history of musical theater. It introduced innovative storytelling techniques, incorporating songs and dances as integral components of the narrative, and tackled complex themes and emotions. The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are just two examples of the delightful and memorable music found in this iconic production. The show's impact on the world of theater has been profound, and its popularity endures to this day, continuing to delight audiences in productions all over the world.</td>\n",

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

       "11966  The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are both from the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, \"Oklahoma!\".\\n\\n\"Oklahoma!\" is a groundbreaking American musical with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics and book by Oscar Hammerstein II. The show premiered on March 31, 1943, at the St. James Theatre in New York City and was a critical and commercial success. The musical is set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 1900s and tells the story of a romance between a farm girl, Laurey Williams, and a cowboy, Curly McLain, as they navigate the challenges of their small town and the tensions between the farmers and the ranchers.\\n\\nThe song \"People Will Say We're in Love\" is a romantic duet sung by Laurey and Curly, in which they express their love for each other and acknowledge that their friends and family may not approve of their relationship. The song is a beautiful and poignant expression of the couple's emotions, and its lyrics capture the innocence and optimism of their love.\\n\\n\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\", on the other hand, is a lively and upbeat number sung by Curly, in which he describes   \n",

       "11966  The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are from the esteemed stage show \"Oklahoma!\". Oklahoma! is a groundbreaking American musical, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The stage show is an adaptation of the 1931 play \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" by Lynn Riggs. This modern musical premiered on Broadway on March 31, 1943, and it is considered one of the earliest examples of the now-familiar book musical format, where the songs and dances are woven seamlessly into a well-crafted, cohesive narrative.\\n\\nOklahoma! is a classic story set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 20th century. It follows the romantic pursuits of the spirited and independent Laurey Williams and the charming cowboy Curly McLain. Throughout their journey, the couple must navigate the ups and downs of love, as well as the challenges posed by Jud Fry, a brooding and dangerous farmhand who covets Laurey. The musical captures the essence of rural America at that time and paints a vivid portrait of life in the newly settled land.\\n\\n\"People Will Say We're in Love\" is a beautiful duet between Laurey and Curly. In this song, the two characters coyly express their feelings for each other while attempting to maintain a playful sense of denial. They sing about wanting to avoid public speculation about their budding romance, but in reality, they are subtly revealing their true emotions to one another. It is a tender and heartwarming moment in the show that highlights the budding relationship between the lead characters.\\n\\n\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" is another captivating song from Oklahoma! Curly sings it to Laurey in an attempt to convince her to go to a social event with him. He engages in a charming and imaginative description of a lavish surrey, or horse-drawn carriage, that he claims to have. The song showcases Curly's charisma and creativity, as well as his ultimately endearing effort to win Laurey's affection. Despite the fact that the surrey exists only in his imagination, Laurey is won over by Curly's poetic descriptions and flirtatiousness.\\n\\nThe stage show Oklahoma! was a landmark production in the history of musical theater. It introduced innovative storytelling techniques, incorporating songs and dances as integral components of the narrative, and tackled complex themes and emotions. The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are just two examples of the delightful and memorable music found in this iconic production. The show's impact on the world of theater has been profound, and its popularity endures to this day, continuing to delight audiences in productions all over the world.  \n",

It is a tender and heartwarming moment in the show that highlights the budding relationship between the lead characters.\\n\\n\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" is another captivating song from Oklahoma! Curly sings it to Laurey in an attempt to convince her to go to a social event with him. He engages in a charming and imaginative description of a lavish surrey, or horse-drawn carriage, that he claims to have. The song showcases Curly's charisma and creativity, as well as his ultimately endearing effort to win Laurey's affection. Despite the fact that the surrey exists only in his imagination, Laurey is won over by Curly's poetic descriptions and flirtatiousness.\\n\\nThe stage show Oklahoma! was a landmark production in the history of musical theater. It introduced innovative storytelling techniques, incorporating songs and dances as integral components of the narrative, and tackled complex themes and emotions. The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are just two examples of the delightful and memorable music found in this iconic production. The show's impact on the world of theater has been profound, and its popularity endures to this day, continuing to delight audiences in productions all over the world.</td>\n",

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

The show premiered on March 31, 1943, at the St. James Theatre in New York City and was a critical and commercial success. The musical is set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 1900s and tells the story of a romance between a farm girl, Laurey Williams, and a cowboy, Curly McLain, as they navigate the challenges of their small town and the tensions between the farmers and the ranchers.\\n\\nThe song \"People Will Say We're in Love\" is a romantic duet sung by Laurey and Curly, in which they express their love for each other and acknowledge that their friends and family may not approve of their relationship.

The passage also mentions that the technique can be used in underground tube stations, airports, and train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking.

The phrase \"what appear to be tourists\" implies that the people might not necessarily be tourists, but they are being described as such.\\n2. \"mill about\" - This verb phrase indicates that the people are moving around, but not necessarily in a specific direction or with a specific purpose. It's a vague description of their activity.\\n3. \"on an urban plaza\" - This phrase provides context about the location where the people are gathered. It's an urban area, which is a public space.\\n4. \"that includes a large fountain showcasing a tall sculpture with a nautical theme\" - This phrase provides additional context about the plaza, including the presence of a fountain and a sculpture with a nautical theme.\\n\\nFrom this information, we can conclude that:\\n\\n* There is a group of people present (from \"A gathering of what appear to be tourists\").\\n* The people are moving around, but it's not clear what they're doing or where they're going (from \"mill about\").\\n* The group is located in an urban plaza, which   \n",

       "0  The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are from the esteemed stage show \"Oklahoma!\". Oklahoma! is a groundbreaking American musical, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The stage show is an adaptation of the 1931 play \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" by Lynn Riggs. This modern musical premiered on Broadway on March 31, 1943, and it is considered one of the earliest examples of the now-familiar book musical format, where the songs and dances are woven seamlessly into a well-crafted, cohesive narrative.\\n\\nOklahoma! is a classic story set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 20th century. It follows the romantic pursuits of the spirited and independent Laurey Williams and the charming cowboy Curly McLain. Throughout their journey, the couple must navigate the ups and downs of love, as well as the challenges posed by Jud Fry, a brooding and dangerous farmhand who covets Laurey. The musical captures the essence of rural America at that time and paints a vivid portrait of life in the newly settled land.\\n\\n\"People Will Say We're in Love\" is a beautiful duet between Laurey and Curly. In this song, the two characters coyly express their feelings for each other while attempting to maintain a playful sense of denial. They sing about wanting to avoid public speculation about their budding romance, but in reality, they are subtly revealing their true emotions to one another. It is a tender and heartwarming moment in the show that highlights the budding relationship between the lead characters.\\n\\n\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" is another captivating song from Oklahoma! Curly sings it to Laurey in an attempt to convince her to go to a social event with him. He engages in a charming and imaginative description of a lavish surrey, or horse-drawn carriage, that he claims to have. The song showcases Curly's charisma and creativity, as well as his ultimately endearing effort to win Laurey's affection. Despite the fact that the surrey exists only in his imagination, Laurey is won over by Curly's poetic descriptions and flirtatiousness.\\n\\nThe stage show Oklahoma! was a landmark production in the history of musical theater. It introduced innovative storytelling techniques, incorporating songs and dances as integral components of the narrative, and tackled complex themes and emotions.

       "11966  The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are from the esteemed stage show \"Oklahoma!\". Oklahoma! is a groundbreaking American musical, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The stage show is an adaptation of the 1931 play \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" by Lynn Riggs. This modern musical premiered on Broadway on March 31, 1943, and it is considered one of the earliest examples of the now-familiar book musical format, where the songs and dances are woven seamlessly into a well-crafted, cohesive narrative.\\n\\nOklahoma! is a classic story set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 20th century. It follows the romantic pursuits of the spirited and independent Laurey Williams and the charming cowboy Curly McLain. Throughout their journey, the couple must navigate the ups and downs of love, as well as the challenges posed by Jud Fry, a brooding and dangerous farmhand who covets Laurey. The musical captures the essence of rural America at that time and paints a vivid portrait of life in the newly settled land.\\n\\n\"People Will Say We're in Love\" is a beautiful duet between Laurey and Curly. In this song, the two characters coyly express their feelings for each other while attempting to maintain a playful sense of denial. They sing about wanting to avoid public speculation about their budding romance, but in reality, they are subtly revealing their true emotions to one another. It is a tender and heartwarming moment in the show that highlights the budding relationship between the lead characters.\\n\\n\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" is another captivating song from Oklahoma! Curly sings it to Laurey in an attempt to convince her to go to a social event with him. He engages in a charming and imaginative description of a lavish surrey, or horse-drawn carriage, that he claims to have. The song showcases Curly's charisma and creativity, as well as his ultimately endearing effort to win Laurey's affection. Despite the fact that the surrey exists only in his imagination, Laurey is won over by Curly's poetic descriptions and flirtatiousness.\\n\\nThe stage show Oklahoma! was a landmark production in the history of musical theater. It introduced innovative storytelling techniques, incorporating songs and dances as integral components of the narrative, and tackled complex themes and emotions. The songs \"People Will Say We're in Love\" and \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" are just two examples of the delightful and memorable music found in this iconic production. The show's impact on the world of theater has been profound, and its popularity endures to this day, continuing to delight audiences in productions all over the world.   \n",
