It has been cultivated there for more than 5,000 years. It is prominently featured in many cuisines throughout the world. Some of them are Italian, Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian cuisines. It grows to between 30–60\\xa0cm tall. It has light green, silky leaves 3–5\\xa0cm long and 1–3\\xa0cm broad. The leaves are opposite each other. The flowers are quite big. They are white in color and arranged as a spike.',\n",
